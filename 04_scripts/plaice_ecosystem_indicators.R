## Developing candidate Climate and Ecosystem Considerations for the New England Fishery Management Council's Risk Policy
## Indicators informed by ToR1 of the 2022 Research Track Assessment of American plaice

## Author: M.T.Grezlik

## Indicator: Annual mean bottom temperature anomaly
## Proxy for distribution shifts in response to temperature
## Significant positive correlation with fall and spring mean latitude (i.e. Plaice move Northeast with higher temperatures)
