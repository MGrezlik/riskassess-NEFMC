# riskassess-NEFMC

Developing candidate indicators for the NEFMC Risk Policy.
The NEFMC Risk Policy Statement and Concept (2025) is available at: https://www.nefmc.org/committees/risk-policy-working-group
"The Council anticipates that the NEFSC will continue to provide timely updates to the State of the Ecosystem report for use by Plan Development Teams in the completion of factor scoring."
In this repo, we draft candidate indicators which quantify the Risk Policy Factors identified by the Council.
These indicators could be included in the State of the Ecosystem report or provided to the Council in a stand alone report.
